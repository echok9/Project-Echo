        <h2>Echo's Story</h2>
        <p>Her father was a first responder who helped many in their lives. He struggled with mental health problems but was always with his K9 Echo. She made him happy and did everything she could to be there for him.</p>
        <p>Through Echo, we aim to offer information on mental health, local places to get help, and statistics on first responders affected. We also share adoption opportunities for service animals and donate coins to support these causes.</p>
